## Command Line Tools (Xcode)

In order for Homebrew and other tools to work, we'll need to rely on a number of programs that
come pre-installed on Linux. Install these tools **via the terminal** using the
command:

```shell
# macOS ONLY
xcode-select --install
```

If the dialog box below appears, you should click on the `Install` button.

This may require that you run a Software Update before proceeding.

If you see a message similar to the one below, you are all set to continue!
```
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```
