# Notes

## Common Problems

Here is a list of common issues encountered during installfest

### PATH issues
**Problem** Using default version of Ruby or Node (not the ones installed through homebrew with rbenv and nvm)

`/bin` should not be in the location of the software we use

-   `which ruby` should output something like `/Users/<username>/.rbenv/shims/ruby`

-   `which node` should output something like `/Users/<username>/.nvm/versions/node/v<node_version>/bin/node`

In the result of `echo $PATH`
the location of rbenv and nvm should come before `/usr/local/bin`

**Solution** Ensure that nvm and rbenv were installed correctly

-   Issues with ruby
    - The `ruby.sh` script adds the following snippet to ~/.bashrc that sets up the path for rbenv. Make sure it was successfully added.
    ```
    if which rbenv > /dev/null; then
      eval "$(rbenv init -)"
    fi
    ```
-   Issues with node
    - The `nvm.sh` script adds the following snippet to ~/.bashrc that sets up the path for node. Make sure it was successfully added.
    ```
    . $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
    ```

### ESlint in Atom
**Problem** Pop ups in Atom in JavaScript file complaining about ESlint

**Solution** ESlint should be disabled if no config file is found in repo. This is the default, but sometimes doesn't get set

## Cohort Refresh

Some maintenance must be kept on this repository. For each cohort:

1. Make sure technology versions are consistent with what templates are using
    - check `node` version in [nvm.sh](nvm.sh)
      ```
      nvm install --lts=boron || nvm install <number_version_of_node>
      ```
    - check `ruby` version in [ruby.sh](ruby.sh)
      ```
      rbenv install <ruby_version>
      rbenv global <ruby_version>
      ```

2. Try to resolve and close (or at least have discussion about) open issues

3. Make sure screenshot of Chrome settings is up to date [Chrome](chrome.md)
