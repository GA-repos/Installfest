## Atom

The text editor we'll be using in this course is called **Atom**; it was
developed by the GitHub team, and is highly extensible.

**Note: From this point forward you will open Atom from the command line** with `atom <path_of_file_or_dir_to_open>`


### Atom Add-Ons

We're going to use Atom's package manager, `apm`, to add a number of helpful
extensions to your Atom installation.

**During this script, Atom will open for you. Follow the prompt in your terminal and close it when asked to.**

```bash
scripts/atom.sh
```

If you get a `command not found` response in your terminal, you have not
installed shell commands correctly. In the top menu, select `Atom -> Install Shell Commands`. Then, rerun the above script.

Part of being a good developer is using tools that help you make fewer mistakes.
To that end, let's configure a useful feature in Atom: autosave! The script you just ran should have enabled this for you, but we will check in Atom just to be sure.

**Note: Atom may prompt you to install additional packages when you open for the first time.** You should install these, as some packages we installed may depend on the ones Atom is prompting you to install.

Once Atom is open, in the top menu, go to `Packages -> Settings View -> Manage Packages`, and search for autosave.
Then open the "Settings" panel for the autosave plugin.

Ensure the "Enabled" option is checked.

Lastly, in the top menu, go to `Packages -> Settings View -> Manage Packages`, and search for `linter-stylelint`.
Then open the "Settings" panel for the linter-stylelint plugin.

Ensure the `Use Standard` box is _checked._
