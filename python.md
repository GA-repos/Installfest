## Python

This script will install the Python language onto your computer. If you have a Mac, you may have a certain version of Python installed, but we will be making sure everyone is on the same version.

We will also be installing a package that will help us install other Python things called `pip`. 

In your terminal, run:

```
scripts/python.sh
```

Shut down your terminal and navigate back to the installfest repo before moving on.
