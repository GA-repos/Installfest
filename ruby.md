## Ruby

First, the script that we run will install a tool called [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) that is used to manage multiple versions of Ruby, in case we want to switch
between them for different projects.

Then, the script will install the latest version of Ruby.

In your terminal, run:

```
scripts/ruby.sh
```

Shut down your terminal and navigate back to the installfest repo before moving on.
