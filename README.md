# Installfest

Follow these instructions to set up your laptop for work in WDI. If you've previously set up a development environment on your computer, you may wish to skip some of these steps; do not do so without first checking with an consultant!

If at any point you are unsure of whether you have done something correctly, ask a consultant. It's important in many cases that we do these steps in order. In general, if you receive no output, the command has executed successfully. (No news is good news.) If you receive output in your terminal that you didn't expect, please notify a consultant.

**The goal of this is not for you to fully understand everything that is being set up on your computer or what all of these tools do!** You should be focused on following along and completing the instructions. If you have any specific questions about anything you do today, we will be happy to answer after Installfest is complete. 

#### Note for Windows Users
We support Windows 10 but you have to do some extra setup first. Please follow the instructions in [Installfest - Windows 10 Setup](windows10.md) before proceeding.

#### Note for Linux Users
We support both macOS and Ubuntu (an open-source Linux based OS) at WDI. If you choose
to use Linux, we strongly recommend using Ubuntu 16.04. We can guide you through the
process of getting that set up on your machine. If you choose to use a different
Linux distribution, or a different version of Ubuntu, the scripts in this repository
will _not_ work, and you will be responsible for configuring your own development
environment. Only choose this option if you're an experienced Linux user and enjoy
troubleshooting.
